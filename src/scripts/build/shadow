# Shadow was indeed installed before and there is no reason to reinstall
# it unless you installed CrackLib or Linux-PAM after your basic system
# was completed. If you have installed CrackLib after, then reinstalling
# Shadow will enable strong password support. If you have installed
# Linux-PAM, reinstalling Shadow will allow programs such as login and
# su to utilize PAM.
