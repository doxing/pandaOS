# The Xorg Fbdev Driver package contains the X.Org Video
# Driver for framebuffer devices. This driver is often
# used as fallback driver if the hardware specific and
# VESA drivers fail to load or are not present. If this
# driver is not installed, Xorg Server will print a
# warning on startup, but it can be safely ignored
# if hardware specific driver works well.
