# The libva package contains a library which provides access to
# hardware accelerated video processing, using hardware to accelerate
# video processing in order to offload the central processing unit
# (CPU) to decode and encode compressed digital video. VA API video
# decode/encode interface is platform and window system independent
# targeted at Direct Rendering Infrastructure (DRI) in the X Window
# System however it can potentially also be used with direct framebuffer
# and graphics sub-systems for video output. Accelerated processing
# includes support for video decoding, video encoding, subpicture
# blending, and rendering.
