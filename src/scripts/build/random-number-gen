# The Linux kernel supplies a random number generator which is
# accessed through /dev/random and /dev/urandom. Programs that
# utilize the random and urandom devices, such as OpenSSH, will
# benefit from these instructions.
# When a Linux system starts up without much operator interaction,
# the entropy pool (data used to compute a random number) may be
# in a fairly predictable state. This creates the real possibility
# that the number generated at startup may always be the same. In
# order to counteract this effect, you should carry the entropy
# pool information across your shut-downs and start-ups.
# Install the /etc/rc.d/init.d/random init script

# Change directory
cd /src/pkg/standard/${FOLDERNAME}

# Install the package
make install-random
