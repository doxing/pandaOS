# The lmdb package is a fast, compact, key-value embedded data store. It uses memory-mapped files, so it has the read performance of a pure in-memory database while still offering the persistence of standard disk-based databases, and is only limited to the size of the virtual address space

# Change directory
cd /src/pkg/standard/${FOLDERNAME}

# Install
cd libraries/liblmdb               &&
