# This is a library for handling page faults in user mode.
# A page fault occurs when a program tries to access to a
# region of memory that is currently not available. Catching
# and handling a page fault is a useful technique for
# implementing pageable virtual memory, memory-mapped access
# to persistent databases, generational garbage collectors,
# stack overflow handlers, and distributed shared memory.
