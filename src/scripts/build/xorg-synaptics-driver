# The Xorg Synaptics Driver package contains the X.Org Input Driver,
# support programs and SDK for Synaptics touchpads. Even though the
# evdev driver can handle touchpads very well, this driver is required
# if you want to use advanced features like multi tapping, scrolling
# with touchpad, turning the touchpad off while typing, etc.
