# to statistics about the system on which it's run. It's
# written in C and presents a selection of useful
# interfaces which can be used to access key system statistics.
# The current list of statistics includes CPU usage, memory
# utilisation, disk usage, process counts, network traffic,
# disk I/O, and more.
